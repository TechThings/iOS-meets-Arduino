## Apple's MFI program

Apple wants to guarantee a great user experience with all its products. The MFI program (Made for iPhone / iPad / iPod Touch) is to hardware accessories what the app store is to apps: a quality gate (well, it should be but that's a different story). 

Becoming member of the MFI program is not that easy. You have to fulfill certain prerequisites that you can find in their [FAQ](https://mfi.apple.com/MFiWeb/getFAQ). To sum it up: You have to be a company with money. Fortunately, there are ways to circumvent the MFI program.
